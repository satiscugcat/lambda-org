# lambda-org
	An organisational repository for work done by the LAMBDA group at IITGN. An org file is used at the top level to describe the planned activities of the group, and the progress towards getting them done.

## Contribution guidelines
	WIP - Hopefully most of it is obvious. If something is not, let me know, and I'll update this README.
	If you don't know what a .org file is, behold the glory of [org mode](https://orgmode.org/). (If you _really_ don't want to use EMACS, then there is a vscode extension, but it is very minimal compared to the force of nature that org mode is in EMACS.)
