    Some work has been done, mostly need to organise content better before publishing.
    The website has been published!

    Have sent an email, need to discuss in person.
    Have discussed with Math Hobby group members.
** Summer Break                                                         :summer:
*** TODO Project for Physical Model of the Lambda Calculus
    :PROPERTIES:
    :MEMBERS: "Aniket Mishra" "Neal Apte Pineda" 
    :PEOPLE: "John Azariah" "Neeldhara Misra" "Jyothi Krishnan"
    :END:

    Inspired by Prof. [[https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Inge-Schwank-2][Inge Schwank]]'s work on [[https://mathedidaktik.uni-koeln.de/dynamic-labyrinths][Dynamic Labyrinths]], this is a project at trying to make a physical model for the Lambda Calculus.
    Another inspiration is [[https://worrydream.com/AlligatorEggs/][Alligator Eggs]], which tries to do something similar, but is quite a bit contrived in its presentation.
    The hope is to make something more grounded, a basis for this might be [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krivine_machine][Krivine Machines]].,
    If you're interested in this let me know, even if you don't know the lambda calculus that is fine, I can explain it.
    So far, no real progress has been made.
    
*** TODO Organise Reading Group for Algebra Chapter 0
    :PROPERTIES:
    :MEMBERS: "Aniket Mishra" "Neal Apte Pineda" 
    :PEOPLE: "Tejas Lohia" "Shounak Ranade" "Priyanshi Agarwal"
    :END:

    Organising a reading group for the book [[https://agorism.dev/book/math/alg/algebra_chapter-0_paolo-aluffi.pdf][Algebra Chapter 0]], a book which tries to explain Algebra through the lens of Category theory.
    Have made some talkings with NthDimension, but we haven't gotten around to fixing a weekly timing.

*** TODO Implementing a LSP
    :PROPERTIES:
    :MEMBERS: "Tanish Yelgoe" "Arjun B Dixit"
    :END:

    Writing a LSP for a language.

*** TODO Develop Projects for the Next Semester
    Project ideas so we can call students to work on them in the next semester.
    (I think we should also categorise them from beginnner to advanced. This is less a rigorous classification and more so a way to get people comfortable with taking the projects.)
    Current ideas are -
    + OCaml open source contribution.
    + OCaml formal verification project.
*** TODO Prepare for Technical Council Orientation
    Preparing something cool for the the technical council orientation beforehand. This is important because it's the first impact we will make on the new batch.
*** TODO Formalise Club Induction Process
    Will have to discuss details with new technical council.
*** TODO Draft a Proposal for Becoming a Club
    We need to submit a proposal for the hobby group to become a club. It shouldn't be difficult, and should just involve recounting the activities we have done.
** Fall Semester                                                          :fall:
*** TODO Learn OCaml Workshop
    Workshop on the OCaml language, based on [[https://github.com/kayceesrk/learn-ocaml-workshop-2024][this]] by KC from IITM, we can also pick a bigger project from the [[https://github.com/janestreet/learn-ocaml-workshop][Jane Street]] version.
    Doing this is important, as it opens up further collaboration with Jane Street and KC.
    If you're interested in this, please reach out.
*** TODO Rust Workshop
    :PROPERTIES:
    :MEMBERS: "Arjun B Dixit"
    :END:
    Rust workshop based on the resources in the learn Rust page.
*** TODO Formalisation Project with Balagopal Sir
    :PROPERTIES:
    :MEMBERS: "Aniket Mishra" "Anvit Aggrawal" "Gella Naga Sai Krishna"
    :PEOPLE: "Balagopal Komarath"
    :END:

    Project to formalise theorems in circuit complexity in LEAN4,
    This is to avoid some of the "hand-waving" normally done by pen and paper proofs that want avoid wasting time dealing with the complexity of a TM, sacrificing rigor in the process.
    [[https://github.com/satiscugcat/lean-resources][Resources for learning LEAN4]] 
*** TODO Organise Reading Group for PLT
    :PROPERTIES:
    :MEMBERS: ALL
    :END:

    Weekly meetings to read PL papers, so we can stay consistent with our learning.
** Winter Break                                                         :winter:
